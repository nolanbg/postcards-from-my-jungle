For the ‘Postcards from my Jungle’ assignment, I originally wanted to use a dataset of deep sea animals because I thought that would produce the most interesting results, but unfortunately I couldn’t find what I was looking for on Hugging Face and was reluctant to gather my own dataset. I ended up using a more general dataset of marine animals for image generation. I tried using a marine mammal dataset and got results that really just looked like noise. As the class has observed in this assignment, the biggest hurdle was the incredibly slow execution time when trying to generate the images of the imaginary species. Even with less epochs and low resolution, I had time to do all of the other parts of the assignment while my first images were loading. As for the sound generation, I used simple prompts building off of animal sounds that I know and like (ex. Alien loon cry). I have found that for this audio diffuser, excessively long prompts tend to lean more towards noise than anything discernible a lot of the time.
